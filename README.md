## Evaluation Plan

TODO (due milestone 1) - see specification for details

### Evaluation Techniques

**1. Questionnaire:**
   - *Why:* The questionnaire is a powerful tool for gathering quantitative data quickly and efficiently.
   - *Benefits:*
     - Provides a structured way to collect user feedback.
     - Allows you to obtain direct feedback on various game features.
     - Enables you to measure user satisfaction and preferences.
   - *Tasks:* Participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that assesses their overall experience, satisfaction, and specific feedback on game features.

**2. Cooperative Evaluation:**
   - *Why:* Cooperative evaluation provides a less intrusive way to observe and interact with users while they engage with your game.
   - *Benefits:*
     - Allows you to watch how participants play the game and see if they are using it in the intended way.
     - Enables the evaluator to provide immediate solutions to identified problems.
   - *Tasks:* In this evaluation technique, users will be encouraged to perform tasks such as crafting, eating, and attacking within the game, while the evaluator observes and records their actions and interactions.

By combining the use of questionnaires for quantitative data and cooperative evaluation for more in-depth insights, we can comprehensively assess our game's performance and user satisfaction. Additionally, the specific tasks mentioned above will help gather targeted feedback on essential gameplay elements, ensuring that your game aligns with the intended design and user expectations.

### Participant Recruitment for Evaluation

For our evaluation, we will employ the following participant recruitment strategy:

- **Personal Network**: We will start by engaging with individuals we know personally to build trust.

- **Diverse Audience**: Our game caters to a diverse audience, and we aim to include individuals from various backgrounds, age groups, and interests.

- **Qualifying Criteria**: Participants must meet one or more of the following criteria:

   - **Interest in Survival and Adventure**: Those who enjoy survival or adventurous games.

   - **Desire to Enhance Survival Skills**: Individuals looking to improve their survival skills.

   - **Appreciation for Nature/Wilderness**: Participants who appreciate nature and wilderness themes.

   - **Enthusiasm for Learning through Play**: Those who enjoy learning new skills through gaming.

- **Diverse Sampling**: We aim to ensure a balanced representation of participants meeting these criteria for a comprehensive evaluation.

### Data Collection

**1. Questionnaire:**
   - *Data Collected:* Quantitative data.
   - *Collection Method:* Data will be collected electronically through Google Forms.
   - *Tools Used:* Google Forms will serve as the primary tool for gathering structured feedback in the form of rating scores for specific game features.
   - *Description:* The questionnaire will allow you to quantitatively assess user satisfaction and preferences by using rating scales for various game features. Participants will provide numerical ratings based on their experiences.

**2. Cooperative Evaluation:**
   - *Data Collected:* Qualitative data.
   - *Collection Method:* Multiple techniques will be employed to collect qualitative data during cooperative evaluation.
   - *Tools Used:*
     - **Notes:** Observers will take detailed notes during the evaluation process to capture important observations and user interactions.
     - **Video and Audio Recordings:** Users' gameplay sessions will be recorded, creating a multimedia record of the evaluation.
   - *Description:* Cooperative evaluation will involve the collection of rich qualitative data through various means:
     - **Notes:** Observers will document player habits, body language, facial expressions, and any issues encountered during the evaluation.
     - **Video and Audio Recordings:** These recordings will serve as a supplementary resource, providing visual and auditory context. They can be analysed to clarify or elaborate on notes, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of user experiences.

### Data analysis

**1. Questionnaire Data Analysis:**
   - *Metrics:*
     - **Average Scores:** We will calculate the average scores assigned to various game features to assess overall player enjoyment and satisfaction quantitatively.
     - **Frequencies:** We'll delve into the frequencies of specific responses to uncover trends and recurring patterns in player feedback.
   - *Description:* The questionnaire data will provide valuable insights into player satisfaction. Calculating average scores will enable us to gauge the overall level of enjoyment that players experienced. Moreover, analyzing frequencies will help us identify common themes and specific player comments within open-ended responses, offering deeper qualitative insights into player preferences and concerns.

**2. Evaluation Data Analysis:**
   - *Metrics:*
     - **Frequency of Player Deaths:** We will measure the frequency of player deaths throughout the game to assess gameplay performance.
   - *Description:* During the evaluation phase, our focus will be on quantitative metrics related to gameplay. Specifically, we will scrutinize the frequency of player deaths, as this metric can unveil potential challenges or spikes in difficulty at specific points in the game. Identifying these patterns will be crucial for pinpointing areas that may require adjustments to create a more balanced and enjoyable gaming experience.

### Timeline

**Conduct Evaluations (Week Following 8 October):** 
During this phase, we will actively engage with our selected participants. We will conduct both questionnaires and cooperative evaluations to gather real-time feedback on the game's performance and user experience.

**Analyze Changes (3 Days Following Evaluation Week):** 
Immediately after the evaluation week, we will dedicate three days to analyse the collected data. We will meticulously review questionnaire responses, cooperative evaluation notes, and any video/audio recordings. This comprehensive analysis will form the basis for our decision-making process.

**Make Changes (Following Analysis Phase):** 
Following the analysis phase, we will enter a period dedicated to implementing changes in the game. These adjustments will be based on the insights gained from the evaluation and analysis phases. Our goal is to address player concerns, enhance gameplay, and align the game more closely with our intended design.

### Responsibilities
Task Responsibilities and Ensuring Equal Contributions

To effectively manage responsibilities within our team and ensure equal contributions, we have established clear task assignments for each team member. Here's a breakdown of who is responsible for each task and how we will achieve equal participation:

**Responsibilities:**

**Each Group Member Will Conduct 3 Evaluations:**
- **Member 1:**
   - 2 x Questionnaire
   - 1 x Cooperative Evaluation
- **Member 2:**
   - 2 x Questionnaire
   - 1 x Cooperative Evaluation
- **Member 3:**
   - 1 x Questionnaire
   - 2 x Cooperative Evaluation
- **Member 4:**
   - 1 x Questionnaire
   - 2 x Cooperative Evaluation

**Total:**
- 6 x Questionnaire
- 6 x Cooperative Evaluation

**Data Summarization and Analysis:**
- The member who conducted each evaluation will be responsible for summarizing the results.
- Once the individual summaries are complete, we will come together as a group to analyze the data collectively.
- Our analysis will focus on noting common themes, trends, and patterns across the evaluations.

**Addressing Major Issues or Changes:**
- After the analysis phase, we will identify the most prevalent and major issues or areas for improvement in our game.
- To ensure equal participation in addressing these issues, tasks related to making changes and improvements will be divided evenly among team members.
